# Time-Series-Visualizer
    FreeCodeCamp Forum Page Views Time Series Visualizer
    
  This project visualizes time series data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The dataset contains the daily page views on the ```freeCodeCamp.org``` forum from May 2016 to December 2019.

The project demonstrates how to clean time series data and generate meaningful 
visualizations to analyze trends, seasonality, and monthly patterns.

```fcc-forum-pageviews.csv — Dataset (dates and page views)```
```time_series_visualizer.py — Main Python file with three plots```
```main.py — For running and testing the function```

📈 Visualizations:
1️⃣ Line Plot — Daily page views (2016-05 to 2019-12)
2️⃣ Bar Plot — Average monthly page views by year
3️⃣ Box Plots — Yearly trends and monthly seasonality

Clean time series data and visualize trends, monthly patterns, and distributions.
